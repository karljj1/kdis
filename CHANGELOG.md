### Removed

- `KDIS:KException` generic constructor
- `CMake` option `BUILD_EXAMPLES_TO_LINK_TO_LIB`. To determine whether to build a `static` or `shared` _library_, use the official [`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.html) flag option

- Entity state pdu throw exception if `InitDeadReckoning` is not called before `ApplyDeadReckoning`
- All `GetAsString<Enum Name>` functions of `EnumMinefield` to use the optimized `GetAsString` function instead of the old linear search algorithm

### Fixed

- Bug in `VariableDatum` decode where the datum value vector was not being cleared on each decode
- `Minefield_Header` protocol family and version were not being set
- Bug in `CreateTokenisedString` where the extra value was not being added to the string
- Functions `GetEnumAsString<Enum Name>` for all minefield enums were not correctly defined
- Invalid values (over 135) for `PDUType` enum. This affected linear, object and point state PDU from the `Synthetic_Environment` family

- Improved timestamps automatic calculation to include milliseconds for Windows and Linux
- Additional operator overloads to `Vector`, `EulerAngles`, and `WorldCoordinates`

### Changed

- All PDU size macros have been moved into the relevant classes namespace with `public` attribute and type changed to `static const KUINT32`

### Removed

- `GED_BasicFixedWingAircraftt`

### Fixed

- PDU length in `Linear_Object_State_PDU::SetLinearSegmentParameters`
- Bug in all `EnvironmentRecords` where the length value should not include the length of the `EnvironmentRecord` header

- `SetWritePosition` and `GetWritePosition` functions to `KDataStream` allowing data "peaking"
- Missing PDUs in `PDU_Factory`
- `KException` new constructor allowing for more details to be added

### Changed

- `Send` example uses a while loop to continuously send the PDU. Some applications do not always pick up the first PDU

### Fixed

- Some of the `Vector` operators would return the referenced objects and not the new copy of the object. This effected operators `*`, `+` and `-` (thanks Michael)
- Typo in `VariableDatum::GetAsString()` function. "Fixed Datum:" should have been "Variable Datum:"
- Timer in `Logger` playback is not started until the log is fully loaded

## 1.10.0 - 2009-08-08

### Added

- Missing destructor implementation to `Action_Response_R_PDU`
- `virtual` to all destructors to it is called even when a base pointer is deleted

- Incorrect namespace references in function comments

## 1.9.1 - 2009-07-26

### Added

- Additional comments to several PDUs to help further explain each field
- `GetEnumAsString<Enum Name>(KINT32 Value)` function to all enumerations. These functions return the string value for an enumeration (`99` -> `"Value"`). It can be enabled/disabled by declaring the macro `KDIS_USE_ENUM_DESCRIPTORS` in the pre-processor definitions or in `KDefines.h` file. This feature makes the library significantly larger: disable if not used. When disabled the `GetEnumAsString<Enum Name>` functions return the enumerated value as a string (`99` -> `"99"`).
- Website based on `MediaWiki` available at <https://sourceforge.net/p/kdis/wiki/Main_Page>

### Changed

- Moved remaining enumerations from `KDISEnums.h` to `EnumEntityInfoInteraction.h`

- `HeadingPitchRollToEuler` to `KConversions.h`

### Changed

- Country Type in `EntityType` constructor from `KUINT8` to `KUINT16`

### Removed

- `using namespace std` directives from header files to prevent `std` attributes being exposed in the global namespace causing potential clashes

### Fixed

- Bug in `FixedDatum` that caused template functions to give linker errors due implementation in source file instead of header file

## 1.7.0 - 2009-05-11

## 1.5.3 - 2009-03-11

### Added

- Interface in `VariableDatum` for setting an arbitrary binary stream

### Fixed

- `VariableDatum` encoding and decoding
- `VariableDatum` bits/bytes mix up
- Typos in comments

## 1.5.0 - 2009-02-20

### Added

- `Intercom_Control_PDU` PDU
- `Aggregate_State_PDU` PDU
- `KDIS_LIB` (static library) and `KDIS_DLL` (shared library) examples
- [`CMake`](https://cmake.org) which is a cross-platform, open-source build system. The `CMake` file has certain options that allow to specify the version of `DIS` to use (`5` or `6`) and if to link against a `static` or `shared` library. Any future examples will require the use of `CMake`

### Changed

- `KDataStream` only accepts `KUINT16` rather than `KUINT32`, which could have resulted in various buffer overrun problems
- `KDIS_EXPORT` macro now searches the project for preproccesor deflagrate. Use either `EXPORT_KDIS` or `IMPORT_KDIS`. _E.g: `/D "EXPORT_KDIS"`_

## 1.4.0 - 2009-02-05

### Added

- `Intercom_Signal_PDU` PDU
- `DIS_Logger_Record` and `DIS_Logger_Playback`, which logs PDUs to a text file so that they can be replayed, have been added to `Extras`
- `DIS_Logger_Record` and `DIS_Logger_Playback` examples. Included captured data is generated by `MAK VR-Forces 3.10`
- `GetAsString` and `ReadFromString` functions to `KDataStream`. `GetAsString` converts the data stream into a hex string, whereas `ReadFromString` converts the string into a `KDataStream`. These two functions allow DIS data to be logged to a file and viewed at a later time

## 1.3.1 - 2009-01-30

### Removed

- References to the incomplete `Intercom_Signal_PDU` from `PDU_Factory`, which should not have been accessible

## 1.3.0 - 2009-01-24

### Fixed

- Bugs in `Signal_PDU` where `SetData` did not set the `DataSize` and `GetData` was returning the padding that was added to the data
- Bug in `Entity_State_PDU` where `EntityAppearance` was being encoded incorrectly
- Typo in `SurfacePlatformAppearance::GetAsString` from _Space Platform Appearance_ instead of _Surface Platform Appearance_

- Bug in `Comment_PDU` where the PDU length was incorrect while reading variable datum lengths since the returned variable datum lengths value was in bits

## 1.1.1 - 2008-10-28

### Added

- `vc9` send example

## 1.1.0 - 2008-10-27

## 1.0.1 - 2008-10-24

### Changed

- `Signal_PDU` data length is number of bits instead of octets
